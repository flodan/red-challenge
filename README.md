# RED Medical Backend Challenge

Project to solve the challenge as described in the [challenge description](./CHALLENGE.MD).

Unfortunately, I was not able to decrypt the file. However, the challenges 2-4 are solved in the [index.ts](./src/index.ts) file.

## Start the project locally

- Run `yarn` to install npm packages
- Run `yarn start:dev` to start `nodemon` which starts the application and watches file changes.
